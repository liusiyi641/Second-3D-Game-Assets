This is our Second 3D Unity Game that we intend to make public. 
We do this during our school time as a self-learned team and hopefully will publish the whole game to App store in summer.
The models of the forts and everything will be updated with 3d models, and everything including UI or multiplayer setup will be updated soon. Currently it's just the basis of the game and mostly the codes that regulate how the game works.
